* gemcutter[http://rubygems.org/gems/easycrumbs]
* repository[http://github.com/staszek/easycrumbs]

== Installation

If you don't have the {Gemcutter sources}[http://gemcutter.org/pages/gem_docs] yet:
  gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org

To install the gem type:
  gem install easycrumbs

== Quick start

It is really easy to have breadcrumbs in your project. Just type this into any view file and breadcrumbs will work for you.
  breadcrumbs

ERB example:
  <div id=breadcrumbs>
    <%= breadcrumbs %>
  </div>
HAML example:
  #breadcrumbs
    = breadcrumbs

You do not need to specify any more options in models or controllers. Easycrumbs will take everything it needs from your routes.rb file.

The routes.rb file with
  map.resources :countries do |country|
    country.resources :movies do |movie|
      movie.resources :actors
    end
  end
could generate this breadcrumb
  Home > Countries > Country > Movies > Movie > Actors > Edit Actor

== Model names
=== From database
If your model has breadcrumb column in database then it will be used to generate breadcrumbs
  @usa = Country.new(:breadcrumb => "Usa")
  @titanic = Movie.new(:breadcrumb => "Titanic")
  @leo = Actor.new(:breadcumb => "Leonardo Di Caprio")

  Home > Countries > Usa > Movies > Titanic > Actors > Edit Leonardo Di Caprio

You can change column name using :name_column option
  breadcrumbs :name_column => :seo

  @usa = Country.new(:seo => "Usa")
  @titanic = Movie.new(:seo => "Titanic")
  @leo = Actor.new(:seo => "Leonardo Di Caprio")

  Home > Countries > Usa > Movies > Titanic > Actors > Edit Leonardo Di Caprio

=== From custom method
If you need custom name then just create method named breadcrumb in your model
  class Actor < ActiveRecord::Base
    def breadcrumb
      "the best male actor: " + first_name
    end
  end

  Home > Countries > Usa > Movies > Titanic > Actors > Edit the best male actor: Leonardo

=== From i18n
Easycrumbs fully support i18n
  breadcrumbs :i18n => true

Name will be taken from this key if your model does not have breadcrumb column or method:
    breadcrumbs.models.model_name
Example en.yml
  en:
      breadcrumbs:
          models:
              country: C0untry
              movie: M0v13
              actor: 4ct0r

  Home > Countries > C0untry > Movies > M0v13 > Actors > Edit 4act0r

== Controller names
===From controller name
Default behavior is to use controller name
  class CountriesController < ApplicationController
  class MoviesController < ApplicationController
  class ActorsController < ApplicationController

  Home > Countries > Usa > Movies > Titanic > Actors > Edit Leonardo Di Caprio

=== From custom method
Similar to models you can specify custom breadcrumb method
  class MoviesController < ApplicationController
    def breadcrumb
      "Movies (#{collection.size})"
    end
  end

  Home > Countries > Usa > Movies (234) > Titanic > Actors > Edit Leonardo Di Caprio

=== From i18n
Controller can also use i18n names
  breadcrumbs :i18n => true

Name will be taken from this key if your controller does not have method:
    breadcrumbs.controllers.controller_name
Example en.yml
  en:
      breadcrumbs:
        controllers:
            application: H0m3
            countries: C0untr135
            movies: M0v135
            actors: 4ct0r5

  H0m3 > C0untr135 > Usa > M0v135 > Titanic > 4ct0r5 > Edit Leonardo Di Caprio
